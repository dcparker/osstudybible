Building the SWIG Bindings
==========================

You may need to do the following to get this to work. From this directory:

cd package

# Special step for BSD-liks (e.g. Mac OS X):
# edit autogen.sh to remove the "-a" option from cp

libtoolize --force

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

# Rather than make, you probably only care about one of the languages bindings.
# So you might try one of these pairs of commands instead:
# 
#   make perlswig
#   make perl_make
#
#   make pythonswig
#   make python_make
#

# Install the perl bindings
cd perl
sudo make install

# Install the python bindings - you may need to run this with sudo
cd python
python setup.py install
