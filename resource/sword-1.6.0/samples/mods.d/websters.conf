Webster Biography:\par \
Noah Webster: America's first grammarian and founding father of American education.\par\par \
	In 1828 Noah Webster published the 'American Dictionary of the English Language'.  This \
dictionary demonstrates the Christian values which were found in America's educational \
and scholarly systems.  It is from this early dictionary that we have todays popular \
'Webster Dictionary'.  In 1833 Noah Webster, who had mastered 20 languages including \
Hebrew and Greek, published the King James Authorized Version 'with amendments to the \
language'.  In stating his reasons for producing this version of the Bible, Webster said:\par\par \
	'In the present version, the language is, in general, correct and perspicuous; \
... in many passages uniting sublimity with beautiful simplicity.  In my view, the general \
style of the version ought not to be altered.  But, in the lapse of two or three centuries, \
changes have taken place, which, in particular passages, impair the beauty; in others, \
obscure the sense, of the original languages.  ...  they do not present to the reader \
the Word of God.  ...  My principal aim is to remedy this evil.'\par\par \
It was with cautious reverence that Webster corrected misused grammar, removed offensive \
terms and expressions, and substituted commonly understood words for words that had fallen \
into disuse, or no longer carried the same meaning.\par\par\
	In 1834, the year after completing the Webster Bible, Noah Webster wrote a \
companion piece titled 'Value of the Bible and Excellence of the Christian Religion - For \
the Use of Families and Schools'.\par\par\
	Webster, who was considered 'The schoolmaster to a nation' and produced the \
earliest spellers and textbooks for America's school children, believed Christian religious \
values and American public education to be inseparable.  He believed the Webster Bible to \
be 'the most important enterprise' of his life, and referred to the Bible as:\par\par \
	'...  the chief moral cause of all that is good, and the best corrector of all that \
is evil, in human society; the best book for regulating the temporal concerns of men, and \
the only book that can serve as an infallible guide to future felicity.'\par\par \
Introduction to the Electronic Format:\par \
	Beginning in July of 1991 the task of placing the Webster Bible text in electronic \
format began.  The original purpose was to provide Larry Pierce, who produces the \
On-Line Bible program, with a more modern *public domain* text, similar in content and \
style to the AV but with a grammar that would provide better comprehension in todays \
English.\par\par\
	I plan on maintaining an accurate copy of the Webster text.  Anyone finding an \
error should contact me; Anyone desiring to obtain the latest, most correct text, can find \
it on the Bible Foundation BBS, or can contact me in the following methods:\par \

	I would like to thank the Bible Foundation not only for scanning nearly the entire \
Webster Bible but for encouraging me to undertake this monumental work; particularly around \
page 20 when I realized what I had gotten myself into.  Special thanks to Jerry Kingery of \
the Bible Foundation for scanning, and Jerry Hastings for doing some preliminary scan \
cleaning and making the texts available on the BBS.
